    <h2>Where did the name STF come from?</h2>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="span12">
    <p>STF stands for "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_holds#STF">Stepover Toehold Facelock</a>". The original authors liked pro-wrestling, and hence the name.</p>
    <p>It <em>may</em> also mean "STorage Farm"</p>

    <h2>Who runs STF ?</h2>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="span12">
    <p><a href="http://www.livedoor.com">Livedoor</a> heavily uses STF to store image files for its blog, photo storage, and other services.</p>
    <p>Throughout Livedoor, STF handles about 400 million objects (1.3 billion entities) totaling around 70TB of disk space. On the busiest system, it's serving 400Mbps of images without a hitch.</p>

    <h2>How is it different from MogileFS?</h2>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="span12">
    <p>The basic idea is the same. The main difference is that STF by default speaks HTTP and is a <a href="http://metacpan.org/release/PSGI">PSGI</a> webapp.</p>
    <p>STF is also a lot smaller than MogileFS, so you it's a bit easier to read. As of this writing, MogileFS has about 28000+ LOC and STF has about 6000+ LOC. STF runs on plain boring synchronous codebase, so the code flow is a lot simpler.</p>
