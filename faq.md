# FAQ

## Where did the name STF come from?

STF stands for "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_holds#STF">Stepover Toehold Facelock</a>". The original authors liked pro-wrestling, and hence the name.

## Who runs STF ?

<a href="http://www.livedoor.com">Livedoor</a> (part of NHN Japan as of 2012) heavily uses STF to store image files.

## How is it different from MogileFS?

The basic idea is the same. The main difference is that STF by default speaks HTTP and is a PSGI webapp.
